# ai-agent-customer-service
Agent equipt to assist customer with their inquiries 

Here's a high-level **technical architecture** for an **Agentic AI system**, using a goal-oriented task executor (like an autonomous operations assistant or AI developer) as the example:

---
## Generic Project Set up

```bash
# Clone and enter project
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py

    ## This project uses streamlit run streamlit
    streamlit run main.py

# Deactivate when done
deactivate

# Freeze requirements.txt after installing new package
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### **5. Feedback Loop / Self-Reflection**

* **Function:** Evaluates outcomes of actions, corrects course, refines future steps.
* **Tech:** Evaluation models, fine-tuned LLMs for feedback scoring, error detection modules.

#### **6. Orchestrator / Agent Runtime**

### üåÄ 3. **Workflow Overview**

```
User Goal ‚Üí Goal Interpreter ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Memory Lookup ‚Üí Tool Executor ‚Üí Feedback Loop ‚Üí Next Action
```

This loop continues until the goal is fulfilled or the agent determines completion/failure.

To build a **Customer Service Auto-Agent**, you‚Äôll want to combine LLMs with memory, tools (e.g., search, database access), and a loop that can handle multi-turn conversations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### üß± **1. Define the Agent's Role**

* Acts as a Tier 1 support agent.
* Responds to FAQs, processes refund requests, and escalates complex issues.
* **SaaS Customer Support Agent or Digital Product Support Agent**: The customer support agent provides assistance for a wide range of common user needs, including account access issues (like password resets and email changes), billing and subscription questions (such as payment methods, invoices, and cancellations), technical troubleshooting (e.g., slow dashboard, login problems), product usage guidance (like app features, integrations, and offline mode), data and privacy policies, and general platform support (including browser compatibility, language settings, and two-factor authentication). When questions fall outside its knowledge, the agent gracefully escalates to human support.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Choose Your Tech Stack**

* **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o or Claude 3, Gemini-Flash
* **Framework**: LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI.
* **Memory**: Chroma, FAISS, or LangChain‚Äôs built-in memory.
* **Knowledge Base**: Markdown files, Notion API, or a custom FAQ dataset.
* **Interface**: Web UI (e.g., Streamlit or React), or chat API (Telegram, Discord, Slack).

---

### üß† **3. Components**

#### üîπ **Intent Classifier**

* Identifies type of request (FAQ, refund, product issue).
* Can be handled via OpenAI function calling or a separate LLM prompt.

#### üîπ **Knowledge Retrieval**

* Uses embeddings (e.g., OpenAI or Cohere) + vector DB to search support docs.

#### üîπ **Memory**

* Stores session context and past issues by customer ID.
* Needed for follow-ups like ‚ÄúWhat did we talk about last time?‚Äù

#### üîπ **Tool Use**

* API access for actions like:

  * Checking order status
  * Processing a refund
  * Opening a support ticket

#### üîπ **Escalation Logic**

* If confidence drops or sentiment turns negative, route to human:

  * ‚ÄúLet me connect you to a specialist for this.‚Äù

---

### üåÄ **4. Workflow**

```text
User Message ‚Üí
Intent Detection ‚Üí
Retrieve Knowledge or Trigger Tool ‚Üí
Generate Reply ‚Üí
Store Context ‚Üí
Repeat or Escalate
```

---

### üß™ **5. Test Scenarios to Implement**

* ‚ÄúWhere is my order?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI want to return a product.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThe item I received is damaged.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow do I reset my password?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou messed up my last order‚Äù ‚Üí triggers escalation.

---

### üí° Tip

Use Gemini‚Äôs **function calling** or **LangChain agents** to allow dynamic tool usage (e.g., calling `check_order_status(order_id)` when the user mentions an order).

# Understanding Model Parameters

These parameters are used to control the behavior of a language model when generating responses.

### 1. **temperature=0.2**
   - **Purpose:** Controls the randomness/creativity of the output.
   - **Effect:**
     - **Low value (e.g., 0.2):** Produces focused, predictable, and deterministic responses.
     - **Higher value:** Introduces more creativity and variability in the output.

### 2. **max_output_tokens=512**
   - **Purpose:** Limits the number of tokens the model can generate in its response.
   - **Effect:** 
     - **512 tokens limit:** The model will stop after generating 512 tokens, preventing overly long outputs.

### 3. **top_p=0.95**
   - **Purpose:** Controls the *nucleus sampling*, limiting the token selection to the top `p` tokens based on cumulative probability.
   - **Effect:**
     - **`top_p=0.95`:** The model will consider tokens that account for 95% of the probability distribution, allowing for creativity while maintaining coherence.

### 4. **top_k=40**
   - **Purpose:** Limits the next token selection to the top `k` most probable tokens.
   - **Effect:**
     - **`top_k=40`:** The model will only consider the top 40 most likely tokens, avoiding unlikely and irrelevant choices.

### 5. **system_prompt=FAQ_SYSTEM_PROMPT**
   - **Purpose:** Provides predefined instructions or context to guide the model‚Äôs behavior.
   - **Effect:** 
     - The model will respond in a structured FAQ style, offering clear and concise answers that follow an FAQ format.


### Library and Options Info:

- **Creativity:** `temperature=0.2` ensures predictable, focused answers.
- **Response Length:** Capped at **512 tokens** to prevent excessively long responses.
- **Token Choice:** `top_p=0.95` and `top_k=40` balance creativity and coherence.
- **Stopping Condition:** The model will stop at a newline (`\n`), ensuring clean output.
- **Behavior:** **FAQ-style system prompt** guides the model to provide structured, fact-based responses.

These settings create a model that generates concise, focused answers with controlled creativity and a structured format.

- **FIASS:** FAISS VectorStores are essentially specialized data structures that allow for efficient storage, search, and retrieval of vectors (typically embeddings) in high-dimensional spaces. In the context of vector databases or vector search engines, FAISS is often used as the backend for managing and querying large collections of vectors.

### Why would you choose ChatGoogleGenerativeAI over Vertex AI for building a customer service agent?

For a customer service agent, ChatGoogleGenerativeAI provides a specialized, highly optimized solution for handling dynamic, multi-turn conversations, understanding user intent, and generating natural, contextually appropriate responses. These are all essential features for ensuring a smooth and effective customer service experience. On the other hand, Vertex AI may be better suited for more complex, multi-modal AI tasks but may not have the same out-of-the-box conversational capabilities as ChatGoogleGenerativeAI.
