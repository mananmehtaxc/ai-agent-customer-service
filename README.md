# ai-agent-customer-service
Agent equipt to assist customer with their inquiries 

Here's a high-level **technical architecture** for an **Agentic AI system**, using a goal-oriented task executor (like an autonomous operations assistant or AI developer) as the example:

---
## Generic Project Set up

```bash
# Clone and enter project
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```


---

### 🧠 1. **Core Components of Agentic AI Architecture**

#### **1. Goal Interpreter / Task Interface**

* **Input:** Natural language goals or structured prompts.
* **Function:** Parses and translates user input into actionable objectives.
* **Tech:** NLP models (e.g., GPT), embedding models.

#### **2. Planning & Reasoning Engine**

* **Input:** Objective from interpreter.
* **Function:** Breaks down goals into sub-tasks, defines sequences, resolves dependencies.
* **Tech:** Large Language Models + symbolic planners (e.g., PDDL), or tool-augmented agents like LangGraph or ReAct-style agents.

#### **3. Memory & Context Store**

* **Function:** Stores historical actions, results, intermediate steps, and external data.
* **Tech:** Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate), key-value stores, time-based logs.

#### **4. Tool Integration Layer**

* **Function:** Executes API calls, file operations, code execution, UI interaction, or robotic control.
* **Tech:** LangChain tools, Python scripts, browser automation (e.g., Puppeteer), CLI, cloud SDKs.

#### **5. Feedback Loop / Self-Reflection**

* **Function:** Evaluates outcomes of actions, corrects course, refines future steps.
* **Tech:** Evaluation models, fine-tuned LLMs for feedback scoring, error detection modules.

#### **6. Orchestrator / Agent Runtime**

* **Function:** Manages execution flow, error recovery, retries, and inter-agent communication.
* **Tech:** LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, custom DAG/workflow engines.

### 🔧 2. **Infrastructure Stack**

| Layer                | Tools/Examples                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM Model**        | Gemini-Flash, OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude 3, Mistral, fine-tuned LLaMA |
| **Embedding/Memory** | FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone                            |
| **Execution**        | Docker, Kubernetes (for task isolation)            |
| **Observability**    | LangSmith, Prometheus, Sentry                      |
| **Data Sources**     | APIs, CRMs, databases, cloud services              |

### 🌀 3. **Workflow Overview**

```
User Goal → Goal Interpreter → Planner → Memory Lookup → Tool Executor → Feedback Loop → Next Action
```

This loop continues until the goal is fulfilled or the agent determines completion/failure.

---

To build a **Customer Service Auto-Agent**, you’ll want to combine LLMs with memory, tools (e.g., search, database access), and a loop that can handle multi-turn conversations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### 🧱 **1. Define the Agent's Role**

* Acts as a Tier 1 support agent.
* Responds to FAQs, processes refund requests, and escalates complex issues.

---

### ⚙️ **2. Choose Your Tech Stack**

* **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o or Claude 3, Gemini-Flash
* **Framework**: LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI.
* **Memory**: Chroma, FAISS, or LangChain’s built-in memory.
* **Knowledge Base**: Markdown files, Notion API, or a custom FAQ dataset.
* **Interface**: Web UI (e.g., Streamlit or React), or chat API (Telegram, Discord, Slack).

---

### 🧠 **3. Components**

#### 🔹 **Intent Classifier**

* Identifies type of request (FAQ, refund, product issue).
* Can be handled via OpenAI function calling or a separate LLM prompt.

#### 🔹 **Knowledge Retrieval**

* Uses embeddings (e.g., OpenAI or Cohere) + vector DB to search support docs.

#### 🔹 **Memory**

* Stores session context and past issues by customer ID.
* Needed for follow-ups like “What did we talk about last time?”

#### 🔹 **Tool Use**

* API access for actions like:

  * Checking order status
  * Processing a refund
  * Opening a support ticket

#### 🔹 **Escalation Logic**

* If confidence drops or sentiment turns negative, route to human:

  * “Let me connect you to a specialist for this.”

---

### 🌀 **4. Workflow**

```text
User Message →
Intent Detection →
Retrieve Knowledge or Trigger Tool →
Generate Reply →
Store Context →
Repeat or Escalate
```

---

### 🧪 **5. Test Scenarios to Implement**

* “Where is my order?”
* “I want to return a product.”
* “The item I received is damaged.”
* “How do I reset my password?”
* “You messed up my last order” → triggers escalation.

---

### 💡 Tip

Use Gemini’s **function calling** or **LangChain agents** to allow dynamic tool usage (e.g., calling `check_order_status(order_id)` when the user mentions an order).

## Why would you choose ChatGoogleGenerativeAI over Vertex AI for building a customer service agent?


For a customer service agent, ChatGoogleGenerativeAI provides a specialized, highly optimized solution for handling dynamic, multi-turn conversations, understanding user intent, and generating natural, contextually appropriate responses. These are all essential features for ensuring a smooth and effective customer service experience. On the other hand, Vertex AI may be better suited for more complex, multi-modal AI tasks but may not have the same out-of-the-box conversational capabilities as ChatGoogleGenerativeAI.
